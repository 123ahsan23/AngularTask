# AngularTask
In this repository i have create a Restaurant App with only Sign Up and Login Form and it works perfectly .
In the Sign up and Login i have added auth guard which will detect whether the person is signup or not and also check for login 
The person that is in db.json when log in then the dashboard opens , otherwise it says "Wrong Credentials" 

I'll try my best to do this task and this is my first time i do authorization in Angular and use AuthGuard for authorization.
